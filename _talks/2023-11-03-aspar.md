For my master thesis with Mariana. In this thesis, I must promote the use of [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) data practices among researchers in the *Aspergillus* field. I presented my work at the [ASPAR_KR conference](https://www.aspar.website/).  This conference was held with the aim of furthering cooperation in the *Aspergillus* field. 

You'll find the slides I presented below.
