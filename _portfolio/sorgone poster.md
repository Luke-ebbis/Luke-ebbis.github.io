At the HAN, to finalise the plant biotechnology course, I had to present a poster. For this assignment, we had to come up with a novel biotechnology concept and present it. Since I worked with *Sorghum bicolor* in the lab before, I knew that the plant has the ability to exude chemicals to control the soil microbiome, and plants growing around it. This is called _allopathy_. The benefits I envisioned are outlined below.

The poster, typeset using the $\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ `beamer` package, can be viewed [here](https://git.wur.nl/sibbe.bakker/public-portfolio/-/raw/main/presentations/poster/bachelor/main.pdf?ref_type=heads&inline=false).
