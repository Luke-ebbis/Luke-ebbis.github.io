Education
======

* Msc science: Wageningen university and research, 2024 (expected).

* Bsc science: Applied university of Arnhem Nijmegen, 2022.

  

Work experience
======
* 2023 -- In process: **Msc thesis** *WUR genetics department*. Wageningen. <br>With supervision from Mariana Silva I am laying the ground work for the aspar_kr
  data sharing system for researchers in the field of *Aspergillus fumigatus*. During this
  thesis I am contributing code to the FAIRDS project, a java programme to generate
  excel templates and convert them into a linked data format.
* 2022: **Bsc Thesis** *FAU Lehrstuhl f√ºr Zellbiologie.* Erlangen, Germany. Grade: 8. <br>Internship supervised by Dr Peter-Louis Plaumann. Worked on a pipeline to phenotype
  photosynthetic performance of mutants of *Vitis vinifera* (grapevine) in a greenhouse
  setting, in this research I had to use the LICOR 6800 instrument. I have also worked on a
  sequencing pipeline to detect SNPs by comparing Illumina reads from *V. vinifera* reads
  to reference genomes. For this I also had to implement a DNA extraction procedure.
* 2021: **Bsc Internship** *Wur ecology and nature management*. Wageningen. Grade 8. <br> Internship supervised by Eline Ampt Msc. I have worked with Eline on determining the
  ecological role of pathogenic fungi in a grassland ecosystem. For this I had to create and
  use PCR tests, fungal culture, field work for sample collection and statistical analysis
  such as mixed models and PCA.

# Skills

## Interpersonal

Explaining
:	I am able to help my colleagues with understanding statistical analysis methods and
programming languages and help with solving computer issues. Examples: helping a
colleague set up git version management, or helping to solve a python error.

Translational
:	Because of my laboratory background and bioinformatics experience, I am able to
translate well between bench work and computational work.

Presentation
:	I am able to use professional typesetting and data presentation programmes such as
$\mathrm{\LaTeX}$ and `quarto` to prepare reports and presentations. I like writing and presenting
information to others.

## Domain 

Adaptable Programmer
:	I am able to quickly pick up on new programming concepts and languages and apply them to solve problems. With R I can make statistical analyses and visualisations with a broad context: from architectural calculations to ecological modelling. I am able to use `R` not just for the creation of scripts, but also for making more complicated web programmes. With `python`, I am able to implement scripts to parse data, call command line programmes, write output and implement common bioinformatics  algorithms. I am also able to implement workflows in `snakemake`. I am comfortable with using java. In
my free time study I `rust`.
