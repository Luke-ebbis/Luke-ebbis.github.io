I am a graduated bioinformatician with a good background in plant biology.
Recently I have finished my internship project on the prediction of protein
complexes under supervision of [Dirk
Walther](https://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/9657/Dirk_Walther) at the Max Planck
Institute for Plant Physology. Currently I am employed part-time at the
Bioinformatics department on a FAIR data project.

In my free time I do swing dancing and do hikes in the forest. I also much
enjoy photography and calligraphy as a hobby and I use my [Mastodon
account](https://mastodon.social/@sibbe/) to tell people about my hobbies.
