I am a bioinformatics student with a good background in plant biology. During
my bachelor plant sciences at the HAN, I always enjoyed the data analysis phase
of the lab work most. Because of this, I chose the bioinformatics study at the
WUR. At the master, I always enjoyed the collaborative and interdisciplinary aspects of bioinformatics.

Now I am working on my Msc thesis where I work on promoting FAIR data practices
as part of the [ASPAR_KR](https://www.aspar.website/) project.
within the genetics department. For this thesis, I need to develop a java
programme for standardising data, conduct interviews with researchers, and
presenting at a [small conference](https://luke-ebbis.github.io/talks/2023-11-03-aspar-kr).

I speak Dutch and English fluently and I am a beginning speaker in German.  I am able to quickly learn (scripting) programming languages, and I possess a solid understanding of python and R. During my free time I do swing dancing, read science-fiction novels and take walks in the forest.
