I am a bioinformatics student with a good background in plant biology. During
my bachelor plant sciences at the HAN, I always enjoyed the data analysis phase
of the lab work most. Because of this, I chose the bioinformatics study at the
WUR. At the master, I always enjoyed the collaborative and interdisciplinary aspects of bioinformatics.

Currently doing my Msc thesis, where I need to promote FAIR data practices as part of the [ASPAR_KR](https://www.aspar.website/) project within the genetics department. For this thesis, I need to develop a java programme for standardising data, conduct interviews with researchers, and presenting at a [small conference](https://luke-ebbis.github.io/talks/2023-11-03-aspar-kr).

Besides my [thesis](/portfolio/master-thesis-aspar), I also help my colleagues with data management and analysis using `git` and making their `R` analysis work reproducible. In my free time I do swing dancing and do hikes in the forest.
