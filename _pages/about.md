I am a bioinformatics student with a good background in plant biology. During
my bachelor plant sciences at the HAN, I always enjoyed the data analysis phase
of the lab work most. Because of this, I chose the bioinformatics study at the
WUR. At the master, I always enjoyed the collaborative and interdisciplinary
aspects of bioinformatics.

Recently I finished my [Msc thesis](/portfolio/master-thesis-aspar) on finding
a method to produce FAIR data from data collected from laboratory analysts in
the Genetics department in Wageningen.  I presented my work at a [small
conference](https://luke-ebbis.github.io/talks/2023-11-03-aspar-kr). Currently
I am writing an NWO-M1 grant to extend my work in the data sharing space.

Besides the proposal writing I also help my colleagues with data management
and analysis using `git` and making their `R` analysis work reproducible. In my
free time I do swing dancing and do hikes in the forest.
